# **Programming - Join Us as a Contributor!**

The AI Learning Hub Open Source platform invites you to contribute to the **Programming** section. This section lays the foundation for understanding programming and scripting languages essential for machine learning, deep learning, and data science. Strong programming skills are critical for building, training, and deploying AI models effectively.

Weâ€™re looking for contributors to create or enhance tutorials on programming concepts, not only in Python but also in other relevant programming or scripting languages. Together, we can help learners worldwide master the tools they need to succeed in AI.

Below are some example topics that highlight the kinds of tutorials weâ€™d like to include. These are just suggestions, and we welcome additional ideas and contributions to expand the section!

### **Python**

* **Basics**:
    * Data Types & Variables
    * Loops & Iterators
    * Functions & Lambdas
    * Lists
    * Conditionals
    * Tuples
    * Dictionaries
    * Sets
    * Strings
    * Map and Filter
    * Exception Handling
* **Object-Oriented Programming**:
    * Classes
    * Inheritance & Polymorphism
    * Encapsulation
    * Magic Methods

### **Other Relevant Programming Languages**

We encourage tutorials on programming languages and tools that complement Python or are widely used in machine learning and deep learning workflows:

* **R**: Data manipulation, visualization, and statistical modeling.
* **Julia**: High-performance numerical and scientific computing.
* **Bash**: Automating workflows, scripting, and environment setup.

### **Cross-Language Topics**
