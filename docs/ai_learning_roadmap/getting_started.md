## **How to Use the AI Learning Roadmap**

The roadmap is structured to guide you from basic programming skills to advanced AI and machine learning concepts. Here's how to go through each section:

1. **Start with Programming Fundamentals**: Build your foundational knowledge of Python.
2. **Learn to Work with Data**: Explore libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data.
3. **Dive into Machine Learning**: Understand the fundamentals of machine learning and master algorithms, evaluation metrics, and hyperparameter tuning.
4. **Advance to Deep Learning**: Build and train neural networks, and apply concepts like CNNs, RNNs, and GANs using TensorFlow and Keras.
5. **Move on to MLOps and Model Deployment**: Apply your skills to deploy and manage models in production environments.
