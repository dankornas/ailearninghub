# **MLOps and Model Deployment - Join Us as a Contributor!**

The AI Learning Hub Open Source platform is expanding its **MLOps and Model Deployment** section, and weâ€™re inviting contributors to help build tutorials that bridge the gap between machine learning models and production-ready systems. This section focuses on practical tools, strategies, and best practices to deploy, monitor, and scale machine learning models effectively.

Weâ€™re looking for contributors to create or enhance tutorials on MLOps concepts, model deployment strategies, and the tools that make production workflows seamless and scalable.

## **Example Topics Weâ€™d Like to Cover**

Here are some example topics we aim to include in this section. These are just suggestions, and we welcome new ideas to ensure this section remains relevant and comprehensive.

### **Model Deployment Strategies**

* Deploying models using **Flask** and **FastAPI**.
* Integrating models with cloud platforms like **AWS**, **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, and **Azure**.

### **Containerization and Orchestration**

* **Docker**: Containerize machine learning applications for consistency and portability.
* **Kubernetes**: Deploy containerized applications at scale using Kubernetes.

### **Workflow Automation**

* **Kubeflow**: Automate ML pipelines with Kubeflow for streamlined workflows.
* **Airflow**: Manage data workflows and orchestrate machine learning pipelines.

### **Experiment Tracking and Lifecycle Management**

* **MLflow**: Track experiments, version models, and manage the end-to-end lifecycle of machine learning projects.

### **Monitoring and Logging**

* **Prometheus and Grafana**: Monitor model performance, track metrics, and ensure model accuracy over time.

### **Cloud-Based Deployment**

* Deploy models on cloud platforms with services like **AWS SageMaker**, **Google AI Platform**, and **Azure ML Studio**.
* Integrate with edge devices for real-time model inference.

### **CI/CD for Machine Learning Models**

* Automate deployment pipelines for machine learning models using continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) tools.
